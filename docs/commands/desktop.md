# desktop

`crabbox desktop` drives a visible desktop session on a lease that was warmed
with the `--desktop` capability: launch apps and terminals, send pointer and
keyboard input, capture screenshots and video, collect proof bundles, and check
session readiness. Each subcommand resolves the lease, touches it to keep it
alive, verifies the desktop capability, and acts over SSH without syncing the
repository.

```sh
crabbox warmup --desktop --browser
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab --browser --url https://example.com
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab --browser --url https://example.com --webvnc --open
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab --browser --url https://example.com --webvnc --open --take-control
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab --browser --url https://my-app.example.com/login --egress my-app --webvnc --open
crabbox desktop launch --id swift-crab -- xterm
crabbox desktop terminal --id swift-crab --sixel -- ./scripts/visual-smoke.sh
crabbox desktop terminal --id swift-crab --record terminal.mp4 --record-duration 6s -- ./scripts/visual-smoke.sh
crabbox desktop record --id swift-crab --duration 6s --fps 8 --output desktop.mp4
crabbox desktop proof --id swift-crab --output artifacts/swift-crab-proof -- ./scripts/visual-smoke.sh
crabbox desktop proof --id swift-crab --publish-pr 123 -- ./scripts/visual-smoke.sh
crabbox desktop doctor --id swift-crab
crabbox desktop click --id swift-crab --x 640 --y 420
crabbox desktop paste --id swift-crab --text "alice@example.com"
printf 'alice@example.com' | crabbox desktop paste --id swift-crab
crabbox desktop type --id swift-crab --text "hello"
crabbox desktop key --id swift-crab ctrl+l
crabbox desktop key swift-crab ctrl+l
```

Most subcommands accept `--id <lease-id-or-slug>`; the input helpers and
`terminal`/`proof` also accept the lease id as the first positional argument
when `--id` is omitted. Lease selection flags (`--provider`, `--target`,
`--windows-mode`, `--network`, and the `--static-*` flags for the `ssh`
provider) work the same as on `run` and `warmup`. The desktop helpers reject
delegated providers such as Blacksmith, which own their own machine
connectivity.

## desktop launch

`crabbox desktop launch` starts an app inside the desktop session without
attaching a VNC viewer first. It waits for the loopback VNC service, starts the
process detached from the SSH session, and verifies that the process remains
alive through startup. A short-lived Linux/X11 wrapper can also succeed by
creating a new visible window or focusing a different existing visible window.
Linux browser launches additionally require a visible browser window or browser
process. macOS `open` launches wait on the opened app so an immediately failed
launch is not reported as successful.

With `--browser`, Crabbox probes the target browser the same way
`run --browser` does and launches the resolved `BROWSER` when no explicit
command is given; pass `--url` to open a page. Browser launches default to a
windowed desktop with the title bar visible, so the WebVNC viewer sees a normal
human desktop; pass `--fullscreen` only for capture/video workflows.

With `--webvnc`, the command keeps running after launch and bridges the desktop
into WebVNC (the same bridge as `crabbox webvnc`). Coordinator-backed leases use
the authenticated web portal; the local container provider uses local noVNC over
SSH. Add `--open` to open the viewer locally and `--take-control` to make the
opened viewer the keyboard/mouse controller instead of an observer. `--open` and
`--take-control` both require `--webvnc`.

`--egress <profile>` passes the active lease-local egress proxy to the launched
browser as `--proxy-server=http://127.0.0.1:3128`, so the browser exits to the
internet through the operator machine running `crabbox egress start`. Start the
egress bridge first; the flag currently requires `--browser`. Override the proxy
address with `--egress-proxy host:port` if egress is listening elsewhere. See
[egress](egress.md) for the full bridge model.

On Linux and macOS the process is detached with `setsid` or `nohup`. Native
Windows desktop bootstrap installs a restricted LocalSystem launch broker. It
uses the active WTS session token to create the app directly on
`winsta0\default`; it does not create a scheduled task or read the stored
desktop password. The command waits for a new or changed visible window, brings
it to the foreground, and reports the owning PID, session ID, and title.

```text
desktop launch --id <lease-id-or-slug>
  [--browser] [--url <url>] [--fullscreen]
  [--webvnc [--open] [--take-control]]
  [--egress <profile>] [--egress-proxy <host:port>]
  [--reclaim]
  -- <command...>
```

## desktop terminal

`crabbox desktop terminal` starts a visible terminal with predictable sizing
(`--font-size`, `--cols`, `--rows`). On Linux it uses `xterm` (or `foot`/
`gnome-terminal` on Wayland/GNOME desktop envs). On native Windows it launches
Git-for-Windows `mintty`, which is present after bootstrap and can render Sixel
inline images when `--sixel` is set. On macOS it launches Ghostty via
`open -W -na Ghostty.app`.

POSIX launches must remain alive through startup. X11 terminals also receive a
per-lease title and must create a new visible window before `launched terminal:`
or any capture output is printed. Verification follows the stable X11 window ID,
so commands may change the window title. This rejects commands that make the
terminal exit immediately.

Add `--screenshot <path>` or `--record <path>` to capture proof after launch;
`--wait-visible <duration>` controls the settle delay before capture (defaults
to 2s when a capture is requested). `--record` writes an MP4 using
`--record-duration` (default 5s) and `--record-fps` (default 8), and also writes
a sampled `*.contact.png` contact sheet by default. A contact sheet is a single
PNG grid of frames sampled across the MP4, so reviewers can verify
animation/progress without opening the video. Disable it with `--no-contact-sheet`
or tune it with `--contact-sheet-frames`, `--contact-sheet-cols`, and
`--contact-sheet-width`. Add `--diagnostics <path>` to write recorder
diagnostics alongside the capture.

`--record` requires a target that supports video capture: Linux with
`ffmpeg`/`x11grab`, or a native Windows desktop. Wayland desktop envs are not
yet supported for video.

When `--record` writes into an artifact directory, the same `--publish-*` flags
as [`artifacts publish`](artifacts.md) publish that bundle (for example
`--record artifacts/proof/screen.mp4 --screenshot artifacts/proof/screenshot.png
--publish-pr 123`).

```text
desktop terminal --id <lease-id-or-slug>
  [--font-size <n>] [--cols <n>] [--rows <n>] [--sixel]
  [--screenshot <path>] [--record <path>] [--record-duration <duration>] [--record-fps <n>]
  [--wait-visible <duration>] [--diagnostics <path>]
  [--no-contact-sheet | --contact-sheet=false]
  [--contact-sheet-output <path>] [--contact-sheet-frames <n>] [--contact-sheet-cols <n>] [--contact-sheet-width <px>]
  [--publish-pr <n> ...] [--reclaim]
  -- <command...>
```

## desktop record

`crabbox desktop record` records the active desktop to MP4. It is an alias of
[`artifacts video`](artifacts.md): Linux uses remote `ffmpeg`/X11 capture, and
native Windows captures a frame sequence inside the interactive console session
and encodes the MP4 locally with `ffmpeg`. macOS is not supported for recording.
A sidecar contact sheet is written unless `--no-contact-sheet` is passed.

```text
desktop record --id <lease-id-or-slug>
  [--output <path>] [--duration <duration>] [--fps <n>]
  [--no-contact-sheet | --contact-sheet=false]
  [--contact-sheet-output <path>] [--contact-sheet-frames <n>] [--contact-sheet-cols <n>] [--contact-sheet-width <px>]
```

Defaults: `--duration 10s`, `--fps 15`, `--contact-sheet-frames 5`,
`--contact-sheet-cols 5`, `--contact-sheet-width 320`. The output defaults to
`crabbox-<slug>-screen.mp4`.

## desktop proof

`crabbox desktop proof` is the one-shot visual QA command for terminal smokes.
It launches and verifies the terminal command, waits for the UI to settle
(`--wait-visible`, default 2s), and writes a bundle into `--output` (default
`artifacts/<slug>-proof`). A failed launch returns before metadata, screenshot,
diagnostics, video, contact-sheet, or final `proof:` output is written:

- `metadata.json`
- `screenshot.png`
- `diagnostics.txt`
- `screen.mp4`
- `screen.contact.png`

Recording uses `--record-duration` (default 5s) and `--record-fps` (default 8),
and requires a Linux or native Windows target as with `desktop terminal`.

On native Windows, the proof terminal is Git for Windows `mintty.exe`, launched
into the active interactive session for the lease user and held open so even a
short command remains visible long enough to verify and capture. `metadata.json` records
the verified terminal PID, session ID, and window title, and diagnostics include
the active session plus Mintty process evidence. Screenshot and frame capture use
short-lived interactive Scheduled Tasks inside
protected per-capture directories whose ACL contains only the lease user, Builtin
Administrators, and LocalSystem. Both success and failure paths remove the task,
script, frames, archive, and protected directory.

Windows MP4 encoding runs on the Crabbox host, so `ffmpeg` must be on the host
`PATH` and `ffmpeg -version` must succeed before running `desktop proof`.

For Hyper-V Windows, use a fresh `--desktop` lease acquired by the same pinned
Crabbox binary used for the proof. Acquisition waits for loopback VNC and a
usable active desktop session for `--hyperv-user`; if auto-logon has not taken
effect, it performs at most two explicit reboot retries before the final bounded
readiness wait and verifies SSH remains stable after the reboot. Older retained
leases are not upgraded in place. Run the
provider flow headlessly/session 0, then always release the proof lease:

```powershell
& $crabboxPath warmup --provider hyperv --target windows --desktop --keep `
  --hyperv-image 'E:\vhd\windows-template.vhdx' `
  --hyperv-user crabbox --hyperv-switch 'Default Switch'

& $crabboxPath desktop proof --provider hyperv --id <lease> `
  --output 'E:\crabbox-proof\<lease>' -- cmd.exe /d /c "echo desktop-proof"

& $crabboxPath stop --provider hyperv <lease>
```

Use `--publish-pr <n>` to publish the bundle through the same artifact backend
as [`artifacts publish`](artifacts.md). The default storage is `auto`, so
`CRABBOX_ARTIFACTS_STORAGE`/bucket/base-url env defaults still apply and a
logged-in coordinator uploads through broker-owned artifact storage when no
explicit storage is configured. For finer control use `--publish-storage`,
`--publish-bucket`, `--publish-base-url`, or run `artifacts publish` directly.

```text
desktop proof --id <lease-id-or-slug>
  [--output <dir>] [--font-size <n>] [--cols <n>] [--rows <n>] [--sixel]
  [--wait-visible <duration>] [--record-duration <duration>] [--record-fps <n>]
  [--no-contact-sheet | --contact-sheet=false]
  [--contact-sheet-output <path>] [--contact-sheet-frames <n>] [--contact-sheet-cols <n>] [--contact-sheet-width <px>]
  [--publish-pr <n>] [--publish-dir <dir>]
  [--publish-storage auto|broker|local|s3|cloudflare|r2]
  [--publish-bucket <name>] [--publish-prefix <path>] [--publish-base-url <url>] [--publish-repo owner/name]
  [--publish-template openclaw|mantis]
  [--publish-summary <text> | --publish-summary-file <path>]
  [--publish-dry-run] [--publish-no-comment]
  [--reclaim]
  -- <command...>
```

Recorder diagnostics (written by `desktop proof`, or on demand with
`desktop terminal --diagnostics <path>`) include local `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`, VNC
loopback status, and target-specific recorder probes: Task Scheduler, TightVNC
service, and interactive user state on Windows; `DISPLAY`, remote `ffmpeg`,
`xdpyinfo`, screen size, and VNC listener state on Linux.

## desktop doctor

`crabbox desktop doctor` checks the selected lease without syncing the repo. For
Linux desktop leases it reports VM/session health separately from portal health:
`DISPLAY`, TigerVNC/window manager/panel (or Wayland session for Wayland envs),
VNC listener, `xdotool`/`wtype`, clipboard tool, browser binary, `ffmpeg`, screen
size, and screenshot capture. On coordinator-backed leases it also reports the
WebVNC bridge/viewer state. Failures carry a one-line repair suggestion so you
can tell a session bug apart from a WebVNC/browser-portal bug. Non-Linux targets
get a reduced report.

```text
desktop doctor --id <lease-id-or-slug>
```

## Input helpers

The input helpers operate on the selected lease over SSH without repo sync. Use
them instead of hand-written input snippets.

- `desktop click` moves the pointer and left-clicks at `--x`/`--y`. Supported on
  Linux, macOS, and native Windows (`windowsMode=normal`).
- `desktop type` enters text. Simple alphanumeric text up to 64 characters goes
  through `xdotool type` (or `wtype` on Wayland); text containing emails,
  passwords, symbols such as `@` or `+`, URLs, whitespace, or longer payloads is
  routed through the clipboard/paste path so keyboard layouts cannot corrupt
  special characters. Linux only.
- `desktop paste` pastes text from `--text` or stdin via the remote clipboard.
  Linux only. Crabbox verifies clipboard ownership before Ctrl+V and propagates
  supported helper delivery failures; helper failure makes the command fail
  without printing `pasted:`.
- `desktop key` sends an `xdotool` key sequence (or a single modifier+key
  combination on Wayland). Linux only.

`desktop key` accepts either `--id <lease> <keys>` or the positional lease form
`<lease> <keys>`; the key sequence is parsed after lease flags, so
`crabbox desktop key swift-crab ctrl+l` and
`crabbox desktop key --id swift-crab ctrl+l` both send `ctrl+l`, not the lease
id. You can also pass the sequence explicitly with `--keys`.

```text
desktop click --id <lease-id-or-slug> --x <n> --y <n>
desktop type  --id <lease-id-or-slug> --text <text>
desktop paste --id <lease-id-or-slug> --text <text>
desktop paste --id <lease-id-or-slug> < input.txt
desktop key   --id <lease-id-or-slug> <keys>
desktop key   <lease-id-or-slug> <keys>
desktop key   --id <lease-id-or-slug> --keys <keys>
```

## Failure surfacing

Launch and input failures surface the failing layer directly in the CLI output.
A missing visible browser reports `problem: browser not launched`, a dead input
path reports `problem: input stack dead`, and a broken portal path reports
`problem: VNC bridge disconnected` or `problem: WebVNC daemon not running`. Each
message includes exact `rescue:` commands such as
`crabbox desktop doctor --id <lease>` or
`crabbox webvnc reset --id <lease> --open`.
