# Cache Volumes

Read this when:

- repeated fresh leases spend most of their time rebuilding dependency caches;
- a provider can attach persistent, rebuildable cache storage during warmup;
- you need to decide whether a cache belongs in a volume, a checkpoint, an image, or the synced worktree.

Cache volumes are provider-backed persistent mount points for speed-only state.
They are not checkpoints and not source storage. The synced worktree stays
authoritative, and volume contents must be safe to delete and rebuild.

## Contract

A cache volume has:

- `key`: the provider cache identity;
- `path`: the absolute mount path on the remote box;
- `name`: an optional local label for humans;
- `sizeGB`: an optional size hint for providers that support sizing;
- `required`: whether Crabbox must fail instead of silently ignoring the volume.

Put provider cache paths outside the synced source tree. Prefer
`/var/cache/crabbox/<kind>` on Linux and a dedicated directory such as
`C:\crabbox-cache\<kind>` on Windows. Paths must be POSIX absolute paths for
Linux/macOS targets or drive-rooted absolute paths for Windows targets. Do not
store secrets, checkout state, workspace checkpoint state, build artifacts that
are the result under test, proof bundles, screenshots, or logs in cache volumes.

Choose a key that changes whenever the cached bytes become incompatible. Include
the repository, target OS, architecture, runtime, package manager, lockfile hash,
and image or workflow generation when those values affect cache contents.

## Configuration

Configure volumes under `cache.volumes`:

```yaml
cache:
  volumes:
    - name: pnpm-store
      key: my-app-linux-amd64-node24-pnpm10-lockhash
      path: /var/cache/crabbox/pnpm
      sizeGB: 80
      required: false
```

Windows targets use the same schema with a drive-rooted path:

```yaml
cache:
  volumes:
    - name: nuget-packages
      key: my-app-windows-amd64-net10-nuget-lockhash
      path: 'C:\crabbox-cache\nuget'
      sizeGB: 80
      required: true
```

An explicit empty list clears inherited volumes from lower-precedence config:

```yaml
cache:
  volumes: []
```

The environment equivalent is comma-separated:

```sh
CRABBOX_CACHE_VOLUMES=pnpm-store=my-app-linux-amd64-node24-pnpm10-lockhash:/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm
```

## CLI

For one-off lease creation, use repeatable `--cache-volume` flags:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider blacksmith-testbox \
  --cache-volume pnpm-store=my-app-linux-amd64-node24-pnpm10-lockhash:/var/cache/crabbox/pnpm
```

Flag-provided volumes merge with configured volumes. If the same `key:path`
already exists in config, the flag marks that existing volume required for the
lease instead of duplicating it.

Use `crabbox cache volumes` to inspect the resolved config:

```sh
crabbox cache volumes
crabbox cache volumes --json
```

This command only reads local configuration. It does not connect to a lease.

## Provider Support

Providers advertise cache volume support with the `cache-volume` feature.
Blacksmith Testbox implements the feature by forwarding each resolved volume as
a `blacksmith testbox warmup --sticky-disk key:path` argument. Local Container
implements it with Docker named volumes mounted at the configured paths; the
Docker volume name is derived from the cache key. Apple Container implements it
with host cache directories under the local user cache directory mounted with
Apple's `--volume` flag.

Hyper-V implements cache volumes for Linux and Windows normal targets with
provider-owned dynamic VHDXs. A cache key is single-writer while attached:

- a required volume that is attached to another live VM fails acquisition;
- an optional busy volume prints a warning and is skipped;
- a short host lock serializes create, format, and attach operations, while live
  Hyper-V disk attachments are the authoritative lease-lifetime ownership check.

Hyper-V initializes a new disk once as ext4 on Linux or NTFS on Windows. Linux
mounts by filesystem UUID after cloud-init/SSH readiness. Windows identifies the
disk by its persistent disk ID and mounts it at the requested directory without
assigning a drive letter. The requested directory must be on a drive that already
exists in the guest; `C:\crabbox-cache\<kind>` is the portable default for
single-disk templates. Reuse is idempotent, and provider metadata rejects a key
previously initialized for a different target/filesystem.

Providers that do not advertise `cache-volume` ignore non-required configured
volumes. Required volumes fail early when the selected provider cannot honor
them.

## Existing Leases

Cache volumes are attached during warmup. Crabbox records the attached
`key:path` specs in the local lease claim. A later `crabbox run --id <lease>`
with required volumes is allowed only when the local claim proves those volumes
were attached during warmup. If the claim is missing or does not include a
required volume, warm a new lease.

## Boundary With Images And Checkpoints

Use cache volumes for rebuildable, mutable speed state such as package-manager
stores. Use provider images for stable machine setup, tools, runtimes, and OS
packages. Use workspace checkpoints for reusable source/workspace state that
should be restored or forked intentionally.

Hyper-V removes cache mount points and detaches cache disks before exporting a
Windows workspace checkpoint, then reattaches them even when checkpoint creation
fails. Exported checkpoints therefore exclude cache contents. A fork attaches
only the new lease's requested cache volumes; it does not inherit the source
lease's cache disks.
