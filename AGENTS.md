# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Crabbox is a Go CLI plus a Cloudflare Worker coordinator. The CLI entrypoint is `cmd/crabbox`, with implementation and Go tests in `internal/cli`. Worker source lives in `worker/src`, with Vitest tests in `worker/test`. Documentation lives in `docs/`; command docs are under `docs/commands`, and feature notes under `docs/features`. Release configuration is in `.goreleaser.yaml`; GitHub Actions live in `.github/workflows`. Generated outputs such as `bin/`, `dist/`, `worker/dist/`, and `worker/node_modules/` should not be edited by hand.

## Product Positioning

Crabbox is a generic remote software testing and execution tool. New code, docs, tests, and examples should not mention OpenClaw, Peter, or other project/person-specific workflows unless the file is explicitly about legacy compatibility or release history. Prefer neutral examples such as `example-org`, `alice@example.com`, `my-app`, `test:live`, and generic repository workflows.

## Architecture Boundaries

Keep core provider-neutral. Core may pass generic request/lease context and call provider capabilities for defaults, access, provision, images, release, cleanup, and diagnostics. Provider-specific reconciliation, firewall/security-group semantics, labels, snapshots, hosts, regions, rollout compatibility, and resource naming live behind provider adapters. No `provider == aws/gcp/...` logic in core unless it is unavoidable routing/config glue and no provider hook fits.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `go build -trimpath -o bin/crabbox ./cmd/crabbox`: build the local CLI.
- `go vet ./...`: run Go static checks.
- `go test -race ./...`: run the Go test suite with the race detector.
- `gofmt -w $(git ls-files '*.go')`: format Go files.
- `npm ci --prefix worker`: install Worker dependencies.
- `npm run format:check --prefix worker`: verify TypeScript formatting.
- `npm run lint --prefix worker`: run `oxlint`.
- `npm run check --prefix worker`: run TypeScript typechecking.
- `npm test --prefix worker`: run Vitest tests.
- `npm run build --prefix worker`: dry-run the Worker build through Wrangler.
- `node scripts/build-docs-site.mjs`: generate the docs site into `dist/docs-site`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard Go formatting and keep package names short and lowercase. Prefer table-driven Go tests where behavior has multiple cases, and keep command behavior close to the matching file in `internal/cli` (for example, cache behavior in `cache.go`). Worker code is TypeScript ESM; use existing module boundaries in `worker/src` and rely on `oxfmt`, `oxlint`, and `tsc`.

## Testing Guidelines

Name Go tests `*_test.go` beside the code they cover. Name Worker tests `*.test.ts` under `worker/test`. Add regression tests for bug fixes when practical. Before handoff, run the relevant subset; before release or broad changes, run the full CI-equivalent gate from the README.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History uses Conventional Commit prefixes such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, and `ci:`. Keep commits focused and mention user-visible behavior changes. Pull requests should include a clear summary, verification commands, config or secret implications, and screenshots only for generated docs or UI changes. Issue/PR references: always use full GitHub URLs, every time.

## Releasing

Follow `docs/RELEASING.md` exactly; the flow is gated and mostly irreversible. Pitfalls that have broken past releases:

- The signed tag annotation must be exactly the bare version (`git tag -s v0.39.0 -m "v0.39.0"`), never a descriptive message. `scripts/verify-release-source.sh` requires the tag subject to equal the version, and the protected tag ruleset blocks deleting or recreating a wrong tag.
- Bump every version-carrying file, not just the changelog: the `CHANGELOG.md` section heading plus `worker/package.json` and both root entries in `worker/package-lock.json`. See the Release Checklist in `docs/operations.md`.
- The producer requires a merged authorize-source record at `release/records/vX.Y.Z.json` (binding the tag object and source commit) on `main` before `scripts/build-release-candidate.sh` will build; if the tag is recreated, update the record's `tagObject`.
- The producer is credential-free and refuses to run if any release credential is present; unset every variable in the check at the top of `scripts/build-release-candidate.sh` (the GitHub, Homebrew-tap, and Actions tokens plus the codesign identity and notary profile), not just `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Keep provider and broker tokens out of the repository. Do not pass secrets as command-line arguments. Local config belongs in `~/.config/crabbox/config.yaml`, `~/Library/Application Support/crabbox/config.yaml`, `crabbox.yaml`, or `.crabbox.yaml` as documented.
Tenki provider SSH uses `tenki sandbox ssh-proxy` with Tenki-managed key/cert files under `~/.config/tenki`; do not use Crabbox per-lease keys for gateway auth.
OpenComputer provider auth: Crabbox reads the API key from `CRABBOX_OPENCOMPUTER_API_KEY`/`OPENCOMPUTER_API_KEY` or the `oc` CLI config (`~/.oc/config.json`) and sends it only in the `X-API-Key` header — never persist `osb_` keys in Crabbox config or place them on argv.
Hyper-V Windows guest auth: Crabbox reads the local administrator password from `CRABBOX_HYPERV_GUEST_PASSWORD` or trusted user config, never repository config, and there is no default. It reaches the host PowerShell process only through `_CRABBOX_GP` and the guest only through the PowerShell Direct argument list. Fresh Windows acquisitions escrow it at `C:\ProgramData\crabbox\windows.password` as exact UTF-8 with no BOM or trailing newline, under an ACL limited to the lease user, Builtin Administrators, and LocalSystem, so the Actions runner can start durably. Never place it on argv or in lease claims, labels, logs, or test fixtures, and never trim it when reading.
